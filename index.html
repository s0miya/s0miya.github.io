    "articleBody": "Radiology reports cover different aspects from radiological observation to the diagnosis of an imaging examination, such as x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography scans. Abundant patient information presented in radiology reports poses a few major challenges. First, radiology reports follow a free-text reporting format, which causes the loss of a large amount of information in unstructured text. Second, the extraction of important features from these reports is a huge bottleneck for machine learning models. These challenges are important, particularly the extraction of key features such as symptoms, comparison/priors, technique, finding, and impression because they facilitate the decision-making on patients&#39; health. To alleviate this issue, a novel architecture CCheXR-Attention is proposed to extract the clinical features from the radiological reports and classify each report into normal and abnormal categories based on the extracted information. We have proposed a modified Mogrifier long short-term memory model and integrated a multihead attention method to extract the more relevant features. Experimental outcomes on two benchmark datasets demonstrated that the proposed model surpassed state-of-the-art models.",

    "articleBody": "User-generated content on healthcare web forums, particularly drug reviews, provides valuable information on drug benefits, effectiveness, side effects, dosage, condition, cost, and overall experiences. Applying Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) can help researchers categorize sentiments toward specific aspects such as drug effectiveness, side effects, and treatment experiences. These insights are highly useful for healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical companies, and researchers to assess drug efficacy and safety, utilizing the vast amount of healthcare-related user-generated content available online. However, due to scarcity of annotated data for training ABSA models in the medical domain poses challenges in accurately extracting aspect terms. Also, the identification of implicit aspects poses a huge challenge as they frequently lack explicit names or keywords that directly indicate their presence. The domain-dependent nature of ABSA and the variability of term meanings across domains necessitate the incorporation of contextual information and semantic patterns. Therefore, we propose a novel model called Multi-task Learning based Dual Bidirectional LSTM Model (MLDBM) for ABSA of drug reviews. The MLDBM leverages BERT and incorporates a multi-head self-attention mechanism to produce aspect-specific representations which are further processed through the dual BiLSTM model. This enables the model to capture and analyze sentiments related to different aspects discussed in the reviews. We also introduce various modifications to the MLDBM to identify the constraints of the proposed model. The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models by achieving a performance gain of 8% to 12% on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness when compared to various baseline models. ABSA applied to drug reviews contributes to enhancing healthcare quality by considering different aspects of drugs as shared by consumers.",

    "articleBody": "The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has created a lot of healthcare concerns. Over the past two years, healthcare professionals worked hard to develop numerous vaccines to combat this virus which is truly remarkable. However, a large proportion of the global population is skeptical about the vaccines and the sudden emergence of the new strain of the virus is stirring up mixed emotions causing the use of opinion terms having varying polarities in different contexts which poses a challenge to predict the accurate sentiments from the user-generated data. In this work, a novel architecture namely a deep fusion model (DFM) with a meta-learning ensemble method is proposed for sentiment analysis of public opinions on COVID-19 vaccines and omicron variant on Twitter. The proposed model employed using natural language processing with deep learning models such as LSTM, GRU, CNN, and their various combinations. The purpose of this study is to understand the public opinion around COVID-19 vaccines and omicron variant through the proposed model. In addition, the experiment demonstrated effectiveness with an accuracy of up to 88% in comparison with state-of-the-art models.",

                                    <p>Radiology reports cover different aspects from radiological observation to the diagnosis of an imaging examination, such as x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography scans. Abundant patient information presented in radiology reports poses a few major challenges. First, radiology reports follow a free-text reporting format, which causes the loss of a large amount of information in unstructured text. Second, the extraction of important features from these reports is a huge bottleneck for machine learning models. These challenges are important, particularly the extraction of key features such as symptoms, comparison/priors, technique, finding, and impression because they facilitate the decision-making on patients' health. To alleviate this issue, a novel architecture CCheXR-Attention is proposed to extract the clinical features from the radiological reports and classify each report into normal and abnormal categories based on the extracted information. We have proposed a modified Mogrifier long short-term memory model and integrated a multihead attention method to extract the more relevant features. Experimental outcomes on two benchmark datasets demonstrated that the proposed model surpassed state-of-the-art models.</p>

                                    <p>User-generated content on healthcare web forums, particularly drug reviews, provides valuable information on drug benefits, effectiveness, side effects, dosage, condition, cost, and overall experiences. Applying Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) can help researchers categorize sentiments toward specific aspects such as drug effectiveness, side effects, and treatment experiences. These insights are highly useful for healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical companies, and researchers to assess drug efficacy and safety, utilizing the vast amount of healthcare-related user-generated content available online. However, due to scarcity of annotated data for training ABSA models in the medical domain poses challenges in accurately extracting aspect terms. Also, the identification of implicit aspects poses a huge challenge as they frequently lack explicit names or keywords that directly indicate their presence. The domain-dependent nature of ABSA and the variability of term meanings across domains necessitate the incorporation of contextual information and semantic patterns. Therefore, we propose a novel model called Multi-task Learning based Dual Bidirectional LSTM Model (MLDBM) for ABSA of drug reviews. The MLDBM leverages BERT and incorporates a multi-head self-attention mechanism to produce aspect-specific representations which are further processed through the dual BiLSTM model. This enables the model to capture and analyze sentiments related to different aspects discussed in the reviews. We also introduce various modifications to the MLDBM to identify the constraints of the proposed model. The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models by achieving a performance gain of 8% to 12% on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness when compared to various baseline models. ABSA applied to drug reviews contributes to enhancing healthcare quality by considering different aspects of drugs as shared by consumers.</p>

                                    <p>The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has created a lot of healthcare concerns. Over the past two years, healthcare professionals worked hard to develop numerous vaccines to combat this virus which is truly remarkable. However, a large proportion of the global population is skeptical about the vaccines and the sudden emergence of the new strain of the virus is stirring up mixed emotions causing the use of opinion terms having varying polarities in different contexts which poses a challenge to predict the accurate sentiments from the user-generated data. In this work, a novel architecture namely a deep fusion model (DFM) with a meta-learning ensemble method is proposed for sentiment analysis of public opinions on COVID-19 vaccines and omicron variant on Twitter. The proposed model employed using natural language processing with deep learning models such as LSTM, GRU, CNN, and their various combinations. The purpose of this study is to understand the public opinion around COVID-19 vaccines and omicron variant through the proposed model. In addition, the experiment demonstrated effectiveness with an accuracy of up to 88% in comparison with state-of-the-art models.</p>
